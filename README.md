# Decision Tree Classification with Hyperparamater Tuning

### This project demonstrates the use of a Decision Tree Classifier to predict whether a user purchases a product based on their age and estimated salary. The dataset used is Social_Network_Ads.csv, and various techniques such as feature scaling, cross-validation, and hyperparameter tuning are applied to optimize the model's performance.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a Decision Tree Classifier to predict whether a user purchases a product based on their age and estimated salary. The project involves:

- Loading and exploring the dataset
- Preprocessing the data
- Training a Decision Tree model
- Evaluating the model's performance
- Performing hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    git clone https://github.com/sohamvsonar/DecisionTree.git

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

## Conclusion

This project showcases how to implement a Decision Tree Classifier on a real-world dataset, perform data preprocessing, evaluate model performance, and optimize hyperparameters using GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV.
